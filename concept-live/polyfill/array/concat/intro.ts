// The concat() method in JavaScript is used to merge two or more arrays into a new array. This method does not change the existing arrays but instead returns a new array.

//? example 1
// const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
// const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];
// const newArr = arr1.concat(arr2);
//^ array.concat(value1, value2, ..., valueN)


//the spread operator (...) is used to copy the original array and to push all elements of arg to newArray if arg is an array. This eliminates the need for the inner loop.
// this point to call object --> arr1
