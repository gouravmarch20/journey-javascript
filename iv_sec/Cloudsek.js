// Hi,

// I recently had a phone screening interview with Amazon where I was asked to create a polyfill for Promise and find the maximum number of nested arrays. I was able to successfully complete both of these tasks within the time frame provided. Despite this, I was informed that I did not move forward in the interview process.
