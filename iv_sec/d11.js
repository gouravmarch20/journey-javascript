// I recently had the opportunity to interview with Dream11 for a React Native SDE-2 position. Recruiter reached out to me over linkedin.

// Initial Recruiter Call
// Recruiter provided insights into the company, the team they were hiring for, and the skillset they were looking for.

// She asked me why I was looking for a change, and what my expectations were.
// After our discussion, she outlined the interview process.
// My first round was scheduled for the following week.
// Interview Process ðŸš€
// DSA Round [Difficulty : Medium/Hard]
// This was a typical DSA-based interview. I was given two questions and asked to code them on LeetCode type website provided by interviewer.

// Greedy Problem: Somewhat similar to this problem

// Binary Search Variant: This question was similar to this problem.

// I initially discussed my approach with the interviewer. He was satisfied and asked me to code. Discussed Time complexity in depth.
// Overall the interview went well.

// Verdict: Cleared (recruiter reached out for Round 2 after a day).

// Platform/Javascript Round [Difficulty : Medium]
// I was given a google doc to write code. Later we moved on to JS playground for running the code.

// Rate Limiter: Create a function rateLimiter that takes two arguments: func (the function that makes an API request) and limit (the maximum number of allowed calls per minute).
// CSV to JSON: Write a function that parses this CSV string and converts it into a hierarchical JSON structure, where each node contains its child nodes. Nodes with a parentId of null are root nodes, and nodes should be nested recursively within their parents in a children array.
// Explained my approach and wrote working code for both. Interviewer was satisfied.
// I missed a couple of edge cases in the Rate Limiter problem, but the interviewer guided me to fix them.

// Verdict: Cleared (A day later, the recruiter confirmed I had cleared this round and scheduled my onsite interviews)

// System Design Round [Difficulty : Medium]
// This was a high-level design round aimed at assessing my system design skills.
// I was asked to design a page consisting of winners from that days contest. The list will update at the end of each contest.
// The interviewer asked how I would build this from scratch. Discussion was focused heavily on:

// modularising the components used on the page, the states and props
// Performance (infinite scrolling vs pagination)
// API structuring (Discussion around contract)
// Caching (How & Where)
// scalability of the components
// This in-person system design rounds was great with focus on problem-solving.
// The discussion was engaging, and I was confident about my performance.

// Hiring Manager Round
// We started discussion with projects I worked upon and deep dived into them.
// He asked me questions about system scalability, trade-offs during design, handling technical debt, monitoring strategies and on-call. He also asked about my day-to-day work, my role, and my responsibilities. Towards the end, we talked about Dream11's tech stack, ongoing projects, and work culture.

// It was a productive discussion.

// HR Values Round
// The HR round focused on culture fit and situational questions.
// I was asked how I handle failures, manager feedback, and my motivation for joining Dream11.
// We also discussed my reasons for wanting to leave my current company and my perspective on the people I currently work with.
// He presented a few scenario-based questions to understand my approach in various situations like:

// Tell me a situation where you went above and beyond to complete a task.
// What are your strengths and weeknesses according to your current team-mates.
// Tell me a situation where you failed.
// Verdict: Selected âœ…

// Final Thoughts
// This was a great learning experience. Here are some key takeaways:

// Practice DSA: medium-hard level LeetCode problems.
// Practice as much JS problems as possible.
// Practice System Design problems.
// Prepare Behavioral Rounds using STAR format to answer.
// PS: The first two rounds were conducted virtually, and upon clearing them, I was invited to Dream11â€™s Mumbai office for the remaining three rounds. Dream11 took care of all travel arrangements, including flight tickets and cab transportation, making the experience smooth and well-organized.
