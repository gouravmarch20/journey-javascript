// ◉ Application
// I applied for the role through the Smallcase career portal, and a recruiter contacted me within two days to schedule the interview.
// The process included three rounds: two technical interviews and one culture fit round. The interviewers and HR were very supportive throughout.

// ◉ Round-1: Technical Interview (1 Hour)
// This round primarily focused on my React and JavaScript knowledge, past experiences, and a detailed discussion on the projects I’ve worked on. Some of the Key topics included- deep vs shallow copy, web storage types, scope of let/var/const, React hooks (useEffect, useRef), debouncing, comparisons between different state management tools and so on.

// ◉ Round-2: Machine Coding Round(1.5 hours)
// The first 15 minutes involved a deep dive into my projects, technologies I've used, WebSockets, and event listeners.
// I was then presented with a React-based task featuring 4 interdependent input fields (text, select, range,text) with specific constraints, where values on the left couldn’t exceed those on the right, and any corrupt input would automatically roll back to its parent value along with a few other constraint. The round concluded with some follow-up questions and additional changes.

// ◉ Round-3: Culture Fit Round(30 minutes)
// We had a general discussion about the tech stack I’ve worked with, my understanding of the company, challenging tasks I’ve tackled & a bit of discussion about a feature I had developed in my previous organization and so on.

// ◉ Verdict: Selected ✅
