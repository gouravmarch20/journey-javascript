// I had an onsite interview with Myntra in November, 2024 for SDE-1 Frontend. 4 rounds were there.

// Online Test Assesment
// Technical Interview - DSA
// Check whether two binary trees were mirror or not
// Random meteor question related to weight and direction. Able to solve it with Stack and the interviewer liked my approach.
// Technical Interview - DSA
// Cheapest Flights within K stops.
// Sort colors( I think thats the name in leetcode) where you were given an array consisting only 0,1,2 and you have to sort it in O(n) time and O(1) storage space
// Hiring Manager Round
// In this round the interviewer asked me about my projects, what I have done in my previous organization and questions around those. Then he gave a low level design kind of question around Myntra app. We discussed various approaches. He was very good, assuring me there is no right and wrong. Then he asked me about React and some questions around Performance optimization.
// All of my rounds went pretty well and they were satisfied with my skills. I even gave the hr interview and even got a mail from the recruiter to share documents for onboarding. But here comes a catch. I submitted the documents and waited for 4 days and there was no response from the hr so I called her and she told me that my offer is on hold as the hiring manager told that he is not going to fit into my team as I dont have much experience in react-native.

// Then after 1 month in December I got a call from the recruiter that I have to come to the office and gave another Hiring Manager round. So I went and the manager asked me question related to sprints, managing tasks and then asked me a high level system design question around Myntra checkout and payments and also asked me If I got a task like this what timeline you will give. Timeline I told him and Also discussed approaches. But with every approach he told me the issues with that. He asked me about security and maintaining performance. It was getting pretty hard and the main thing was He wanted me to tell him exactly like how myntra checkout is working and how they are maintaining the performance and security. He was not convinced so I understood that it did not go well.

// The interview was held on a weekday, and there were multiple candidates for various roles. I applied for the Frontend Developer position. There were a total of 4 rounds: 3 technical rounds at the Myntra office and 1 HR round.

// Technical Round 1: I was asked a DSA question based on binary search, for which I had to write the pseudocode.
// The question was: https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/
// Additionally, I was asked JavaScript questions related to objects, the this keyword, hoisting, and other basic JS concepts.

// Technical Round 2: This round focused on ReactJS. I was asked about the differences between functional and class components, along with optimization questions related to useMemo, useCallback, and React.memo. They also asked about the virtual DOM and other common ReactJS topics.

// HM Round: This round was centered around my previous work experience and included some situational questions, such as:

// What would you do if you estimated that a task would take 5 days but later realized it would take more time? How would you handle it?
// Do you prefer team discussions or working independently?
// After these rounds, it took nearly a week to schedule my HR round. I was expecting compensation discussions, but the questions were more about my role, like, "What if you're asked to work on the backend as well?" and "What were the names of the interviewers so HR can check which team was involved?"

// About 1.5 weeks later, another HR representative called to discuss compensation. I told them that I already had an offer and requested that Myntra's offer at least match it. The HR person responded that they would see what could be done. A few days later, I received another call from HR, asking me to accept the offer as it was because the compensation was fixed, and they wouldn't increase it. I agreed, but they still haven't sent the offer letter. I'm not sure what the delay is.

// P.S.: I have received the offer letter and requested to extend my date of joining due to my notice period, which Myntra agreed to.
