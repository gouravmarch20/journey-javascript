// Interviewer didn't follow typical tiktok interview template of trivia and behavioral questions before coding.
// Jumped straight into coding.
// There were 2 problems

// Q1: LC 784 Letter Case Permutation

// I didn't know the javascript API to check if the character is an alphabet letter or a digit. That apparently hurt the interviewer IDKW. Gave a working solution with object that maps lowercase letter to uppercase letter.

// Q2. React based coding.

// Input was given as a nested file tree object. Write the React component to render the file tree with followup of how would I handle toggle functionality for folders.

// const fileTree = {
//   id: 1,
//   name: "root",
//   children: [
//     { name: "index.js", id: 2 },
//     { name: "styles.css", id: 3 }
//   ]
// };
// Literally wrote the "perfect" code under 10 mins.

// Verdict: Rejected LoL
