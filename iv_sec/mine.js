// Hey community, I've been trying to switch from my current company since last 10 months and have given few interviews which I'm willing to share.

// Yoe - 2yrs( 2022 grad Tier 3)
// Current Company - Mid level PBC
// Role - Frontend
// Tech stack - Preact, Angular.
// Applying for - SDE frontend roles
// Reason for Switch - Constant layoffs and no good work and growth.

// Started applying since February 2024.

// Company 1 - Mindtickle
// Role - SDE 1 Frontend
// Applied in - February via Instahyre

// Recruiter reached out to me and asked few details regarding my expected CTC and tech stack and scheduled first round via a 3rd party vendor(had to pick a slot b/w 2 days)

// (April 2024)
// Interview 1 - Questions on React, JavaScript working and to build accordion. Had few discussions on Performance Optimisations and Angular as well.

// Result - Rejected with experience doesn't match with requirements rn.
// Comment - my interview went well but I guess they already selected a candidate.

// Now next 4 months no interviews and applied for a lot of job roles across various companies.

// Company 2 - Oracle
// Role - Application Engineer
// Applied - July via Naukri

// (August 2024)
// Round 1 - DSA
// asked two questions. one was related to Binary search and other was related to sliding window. Did both with optimisation.
// Result - Cleared

// It was a hiring drive and they wanted to schedule my second interview right away but they didn't inform me earlier so I asked them for extension.

// Round 2 - HM round
// scheduled after 3 weeks and ofc I followed up with them for multiple times for next interview)
// HM was specifically looking for someone with Java experience and although I was able to do the question she asked but still she was not impressed and rejected me. Interview went for just half an hour.

// Result - Rejected.

// (August 2024 just after the week of Oracle)
// Company 3 - Quince
// Role - SDE 2 frontend
// Applied on LinkedIn in May 2024

// Recruiter asked me to schedule interview tomorrow and there was no choice for me as they were in hurry and limited slots. I agreed for the interview and scheduled via 3rd party vendor.

// Round 1- Problem solving in JS and React fundamentals

// Well the interviewer directly jumped to a LLD question. It was to design a typeahead component. I was able to create a working solution but the interviewer was pathetic. It looked like I was talking to a blank screen with no response. infact I asked him multiple times, are you there? requirements are correct? His mic will always be on mute and when the interview was about to end he said It was supposed to work like this. Huh? It asked him multiple times during the interview to validate my requirements.

// Overall It was a bad experience and never heard from recruiter about the results

// Result - Rejected.

// (September 2024)
// Company 4 - Servicenow
// Applied - Career site

// This was my 15th application at servicenow.
// Recruiter reached out. They were looking for someone with 3+ yoe in frontend but they still went ahead with my profile. All the rounds were supposed to be scheduled in a day.

// Round 1 - DSA

// Was asked easy medium questions from Leetcode and they were easy tbh. although recruiter was not looking for standard solutions. And then he asked few questions on JavaScript and asked to code for Deep Freeze an Object.

// Verdict - selected.

// Received a call after half an hour and they scheduled my 2nd round right away.

// Round 2 - DSA and LLD

// Was asked to implement curry converter and multiple follow ups and a lot of output based questions and then a LLD of Parking Lot. working code was expected.

// Interview went well and I got selected for next round.

// Round 3 - HM round.

// Interviewer doesn't seems to be interested and particularly asked me to to design Garbage collector and after that asked me to implement Ticket system like JIRA in last 15 mins:(
// Interview didn't go well. But the interviewer had his poker face on and infact he was not even listening to my answers. Why to ask question about my current project when you don't care to listen. anyways bad experience with a manager.

// Verdict - Recruiter told my profile is put on hold and they will reach out me if there'll be some update .
// Comment - I'm assuming rejection. Tbh the interviewers looked so burnedout. So a red flag for me sure. Although I should know internal working of a garbage collector and algorithms used for that.

// (September 2024)
// Company 5 - Arcesium
// Applied via Instahyre

// Had on Online Assessment and I cleared it.

// Best experience so far in terms of interviewing.

// Round 1 - Problem solving in JS

// Interviewer grilled me in JavaScript. Had a lot of discussions regarding my current project and overall the interview went well and got call for second interview.

// Round 2 - LLD

// interviewer asked me to design A Notification system. The user just need to call the method of that notification service to create notifications on the screen and It didn't go well. Although interviewer was good and tried helping whenever I felt stuck but It was not enough. I've never worked with React Portals:(

// Both of the interviewer were tech lead and they were pretty knowledgeable as well. I got a lot of guidance from them regarding frontend and how to improve skills etc.
// Result - Rejected

// (Oct 2024)
// Company 6 - Moengage
// Applied on Linkedin.

// Round 1 - Problem solving in JS :

// Asked a lot of questions in Closures, event loop etc and asked Polyfill for groupBy, call , apply, bind etc.
// Interview went well and got call for Second interview.

// Round 2 - Machine Coding.

// At first recruiter asked me a lot of questions in React like a Rapid Round and gave two questions after that.
// Create a HOC that render component after X seconds and show loader while they are loading .
// Nested Accordion ( similiar to reddit nested comments)
// Interview went well Imo. was able to implement both. Although he was specifically asking for TDD. which we don't follow at my current org. so less experience with Testing libraries.

// Result - Rejected.

// Since then no interview calls from any other company and I'm still looking for an offer. There is huge rumour of having a layoff in next 2 months. If do you have any opportunity for 2.4 years of experience in frontend, then please reach out to me.

// Comments - the hiring bar is very high it seems and recruiter are looking for just one mistake to reject you. Atleast that's what I got to know after interviewing.
