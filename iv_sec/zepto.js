// 1st Interview (JS Round) - Taken by Interview Vector.
// Question 1- Design a to-do list in vanilla js.
// Really messed it here, dont have habit of writing vanilla js code so was not able to complete the entire design. Interviewer was also rushing. He gave me a max 20 mins for this.

// Question 2- A class based problem on pub-sub. Was able to give a fully working solution for this. All the sample test cases were passing.

// Verdict- Received mail within 3 hours that I've been rejected :(. Very disappointed with myself as Zepto was one of my dream company but I'll learn from this rejection and will prepare harder now

// !
// Round 1 (JS round):

// This round was outsourced to InterviewVector folks:
// Questions:

// Curry Sum Problem
// To-do list using Vanilla JS
// Solved both the questions and was moved to the next round.

// Round 2 (Machine Coding Round):

// Questions:
// Code a configurable form UI.
// Prototype Link
// My Solution Link

// Completed this within an hour and after that there were some questions on optimizations and performance. Struggled a bit on couple of questions but answered most of the questions.

// Round 3 (HLD round)

// Design an E-commerce website

// This round also went well and received a very mixed feedback but was moved to the next round.

// Round 4 (HM round)

// This round started with questions on past projects and my role in them.
// At the end the interviewer gave a question to write a polyfill of getElementByStyles.
// I wrote the function and tested it in front of the interviewer.
// This round also went very well and I was confident of getting an offer.

// But to suprise they had sent an rejection email. And the next day HR called and said they can offer
// SE-2 role. I asked for the reason but she said they said to offer you SE-2. Since I am unemployed I said okay and asked of compensation details they said 45LPA. I requested for 50LPA. She said she would check with the team and get back. After not getting any response for 3 days I called the HR today and she informed me they cannot move ahead with my application.
