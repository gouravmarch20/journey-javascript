// Round3(Domain):
// Javascript basic theory questions, JS output based questions, Implement Nested comments

// Round4(LLD+HLD):

// Frontend
// Interview
// I gave my frontend interview for Swiggy on Dec 2024. It was a fully remote opportunity. There were total 4 rounds.

// First Round
// On November I received a online test link where I received 5 problems. It was on the hackerrank platform and consists of 2 dsa and 2 javascript and 1 react machine coding question. machine coding question was file explorer question. Main features were -

// file and folder differentiation
// nested file structure (using recursion)
// adding files to folder
// double click on file would change it to a folder
// Second round
// Second round was from 3rd party platform which takes interview of candidates behalf of the company. In this round basics of javascript, react questions were asked and I was told to do a leetcode question. It was leetcode easy so yes solved it.

// Third round
// Third round was taken by a senior frontend engineer. He asked me react basics like component lifecycle, what are hooks etc. then told me to open codesandbox and create a box and if we are moving over that box area then there will be a circle where the cursor is. then told me to modify it so that If I only click then show the circle in that area but also told me to track the cursor position and then told me to optimize it.(for tracking use useRef thats it) Then gave me a code snippet regarding promise completion in a for loop, how much time it will take, how to optimize and made some modifications around it. This round went pretty well.

// Hiring Manager Round
// This was the hiring manager round. The interviewer was very good. He asked me how I approach a problem. So like If I have to build a thing from ground what are things you are gonna consider So you can think of it as a system design question with no actual target. So like it can be any application. Every aspect I had to discuss. So like planning, component design, data flow, best code practices or you can say what kind of design pattern i am going to follow, performance optimization, testing, monitoring. I was lacking on the monitoring and testing part because I dont have that much experience in these two part. Then he told me what kind of questions you will ask if you get a requirement like building a auto-suggest input. Both functional and non-functional aspects I had to tell.

// Verdict - Rejected. Despite the rounds went pretty well I was rejected. I think it was because of 3 parts. Performance, testing and monitoring. So yeah better luck next time. I hope it helps anyone who is preparing.

// Interview Experience
// I saw on LinkedIn that Swiggy is currently hiring Frontend Interns (React).

// After filling the google forms and contacting SDEs and Managers. I received the link for the Online Assessment from the HR.

// Round 1: Online Assessment

// 1 DSA Question (Easy) , based on Hashing and Arrays.
// MCQs based on HTML/JS/CSS fundamentals.
// React Coding Question: Implementing an API call and passing all the test cases.
// Round 2: Machine Coding Round (60 Mins)
// Idea was to build an autosuggestion input by calling an API as per the given input in react. It's preferably recommended to use codesandbox in this round. Later the interviewer asked me about my projects, previous internships and about react fundamentals.

// Machine Coding round can tend to be monotonous. So make sure that the interviewer understands what you are coding. Maybe try having a conversation in between, ask their suggestions.

// Round 3: PSDS (Problem Solving and Data Structures) (60 Mins)
// As it says, it was mostly focused on problem solving and data structures.

// Note: For Frontend interviews, generally you have to code your solutions in Javascript. Make sure to practice DSA in JS if you're preparing for any frontend interview.

// The questions were mostly related to Arrays, Polyfills, Regular Expressions, Promises, Currying, Throttle, Debounce, etc. Later we discussed about our favourite Tech Stacks & Libraries.

// Next, I didn't get any update for days, then got a call from the HR for conducting my Hiring Manager round on the same day ðŸ™ƒ.

// Round 4: Hiring Manager Round
// Started off as a general round where they told me about the project, etc.

// Questions mostly related my resume, the projects I did and what were the major challenges and few questions related to Deployment pipelines, Event Loops, React, and Debugging.

// Later, the same day I got a call from the HR telling that I've been selected.

// Verdict: Selected

// Few Tips if you're preparing for Frontend Interviews (as per my experience):

// Focus on HTML/CSS/JS Fundamentals.
// Practice Common Machine Coding problems in CodeSandbox before your interview (most interviewers prefer codesandbox).
// Try to keep a good conversation at the end, Technology oriented maybe on favourite tech stacks, technologies or anything related to tech (only if the interviewer likes that, mostly they do because they are SDEs at the end ;) ).
// Act chill (even if you're not).
// Pray that you're lucky ðŸ’€.
// Don't lose hope. Market is real bad.
// Please upvote if you found it useful.
