// Position: Front-End Engineer (EU)
// Stage: Hacker Rank online assessment
// Time limit: 120 min
// Type: coding mini-projects in an online IDE to pass all tests
// Q1: Vendor Phone Directory. You have a markup for a form to add a contact [Name, Phone num, email], a search field input and a table of current contacts. Implement form submit feature with validation, [re]render a table, filter by phone number. Vanilla JS/CSS/HTML
// Q2: Implement accordion from a given markup. Collapse/expand on click. Two modes: only single item expanded and multiple expanded at the same time. Vanilla JS/CSS/HTML
// Pretty easy if you know your basics: events, DOM manipulation, regexes and popular patterns.




// Just want to share my experience interviewing for a Front End Engineer (FEE) II role at Amazon.

// Online assessment:
// Based on the email it said it was going to be a DSA problem - which it was not. So I don't know if that was an error or what but it caught me off guard. Had 2 UI problems in vanilla JS/HTML/CSS - one was building an accordion and the other was a file explorer.

// Phone screen with hiring/engineering manager:
// (2 Leadership Principle (LP) questions + technical)
// After being caught off guard from the initial round, I spoke to the recruiter and they assured me the phone screen would be front end focused. Again, I was caught off guard. I was given a blank/basic text editor and the manager told me to pick a function such as debounce, or priority queue (gave a couple other options i can't remember) and write them up. I went with priority queue. I suppose this could be considered front end (??) but I was not expecting it. It involved writing a function class/constructor. Anyways the manager was very kind as I struggled through it and asked how I would execute things and take them off the stack and so forth. Once he saw that I could think through some various logic he called it and we ended early. I thought I failed for sure.

// Final round:
// 5 X 1 hour interviews
// 4 of them were LP questions followed by technical (was told it would be 2 LP questions per technical interview but it was really between 2-5)
// 1 was all LPs
// Technical interviews were the following:
// DSA problem - this exact problem https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/2480853/amazon-front-end-engineer-seattle-phone-n600q/
// The posted solution is not exactly right. But its a DFS graph traversal problem.
// Javascript function - had to write out JSON.stringify from scratch. It's a recursive problem with a couple tricky catches. GreatFrontEnd has this problem and all the related JS function problems under their Amazon guide. I highly recommend that site.
// System design - basically asked the Cart aspect of an ecommerce shopping cart. I also recommend GreatFrontEnd for their system design study guide.
// Frontend UI - Had to code up an image carousel. I had read mixed reviews about whether they wanted you to work in vanilla JS or react. I prepared for both and then asked what the interviewer preferred, which was react.
// For all of them you are coding in basically a text editor - not a big focus on sytax or remembering helper functions you can easily look up. For the most part they just want to make sure your logic makes sense.

// My outcome
// Every technical question I got I had done in my prep, so I solved everything. So I thought I would get the offer, but I didn't. I think they wanted someone with more experience (I only have a year and change with a company and some freelance experience). They said that I passed for a level 1 role and am offer-eligible. But they have no FEE 1 roles available so I'm out of luck. Best of luck to y'all.
