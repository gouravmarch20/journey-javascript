// Recruiter contacted me on LinkedIn.

// Round 1 - Frontend Technical Round [1 hr]
// This round was more of screening round and was generally around the concepts of javascript.

// Two output based problems were asked revolving around concepts like var, let & const keyword, closures & promises.
// Implement the _get function of lodash.
// Implement Promise.all() polyfill.
// This round went well and I was successfully able to answer all the problem.
// Got a call on the same day for scheduling the next round as I cleared this round.

// Round 1 - Machine Coding Round [1 hr]
// This was a frontend coding round in which I was given a problem to make a UI from scratch. I was given a https://coderpad.io/ link to work.

// Implement a memory game, that has a fixed number of blocks. Ex: 5 (programmatically configurable)
// Start the game on click of START button.
// Start blinking the blocks one after the other, starting from the count of 1. (single blink)
// The blinking of blocks must be completely random and the same block may blink twice in sequence.
// Let the user click the blocks in the same order of appearance.
// If user clicks are accurate, continue to the next level with the increased count.
// Else shake the container to indicate the wrong click and start over.
// Maintain the current score and highscore of the game.
// Store the High Score in Local Storage to persist over refresh.
// My solution: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/47gdz6?file=%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FGame.tsx%3A18%2C53

// The interviewer was very helpful, corrected me at times I was going in the wrong direction.
// For the same index to bling back-to-back , I couldn't come up with the blinging properly.
// Round 3 - HM [1 hr]
// This round was to know the behavioural aspects of my work experience.

// Discussion on few projects, contribution, ownership on those projects
// Roles and responsibilities in the current company
// Few technical problem were asked like If you need to build a product from scratch which tech stacks you would use. Performance improvment of a web app.

// Round 4 - LLD [1 hr]
// This was a LLD round from frontend perpective. I was given to design a mini game(Minesweeper).
// I was asked to work on these few features:

// Two Modes: Easy and Hard
// High Score check
// Filling algorithm
// Bomb check algorithm
// Block data filling for non-bomb squares.
// The things which was checked in this round were mainly around:

// What states will be kept?
// What Hooks will I create?
// WHat methods will I create?
// What components will be made?
// How data will flow and how it would be modelled?
// What logic will be written and things will be handled in each component etc.
// I explained the design using the RADIO Framework.
// This round took place in a whiteboard where I had to explain all the things to the interviewer.

// Verdict: Rejected

// Feedback: They wanted a web developer whereas most of my experience lies in the mobile development role.
