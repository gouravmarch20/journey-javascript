// Interview Experience:

// The interview started with high hopes as I was excited about the opportunity to work with a startup specializing in AI inspection of semiconductor chipsâ€”an area I'm personally interested in. However, the experience of the first round was unexpectedly challenging and disappointing.

// The interview was conducted via a video call with the interviewer sharing their video feed as well. I was asked some introductory questions, and then the unexpected part began. I was asked to share my screen and given a coding task to build a folder structure component similar to that in VS Code, to be production-ready, within 45 minutes.

// Unfortunately, the provided online editor for coding was not functioning properly. As a result, the interviewer suggested using CodePen instead. I shared my screen, including the coding window, and this led to a significant performance issue on my Windows system. The lag became unbearable, causing me to disconnect and restart my system, which wasted approximately 15 minutes of the interview time.

// Once reconnected, I explained my approach to the interviewer and proceeded to code the component using React JS. Throughout this time, I noticed that the interviewer seemed disengaged, and kept resting with heads down, which was quite disheartening.

// By the 45-minute mark, the interviewer abruptly asked me to stop coding and explain my implementation. As I was explaining, the interviewer appeared agitated and mentioned they could see the code, seemingly implying impatience.

// Ultimately, the interview concluded abruptly with the interviewer thanking me and stating that the HR team would provide feedback.

// Thoughts:

// The interview experience left me feeling disappointed and uncertain about the company's culture and expectations. The technical task itself was not particularly challenging for me due to prior experience with a similar task in one of the past successful interview, but the overall atmosphere and the interviewer's demeanour were unexpected and discouraging.

// Upon reviewing the profile of my interviewer for personal curiosity, I was surprised to discover that he is a frontend developer with four years of experience, having held roles with relatively short tenures ranging from four to seven months. Furthermore, the interviewer is currently serving a notice period at their current company.

// In my own experience as an interviewer, I have always approached interviews with genuine interest and professionalism, never exhibiting disinterest or appearing disengaged during the conversation.
