// Status: Fresher from Tier-3 college with 5 months intern experience.
// Offer: 12 months intern + PPO Opportunity for 3rd year students.
// Location: Onsite (Bangalore)
// Compensation: Around 60k stipend per month, 20L CTC (14L base + joining bonus + esop's)

// The hiring process consist of 4 rounds.

// Round-1: Resume Shortlisting
// Applied through google form shared on linkedin by some SDE-2 from GROWW.

// Round-2: Assignment Round

// Asked to develop a checkout experience from CART(with coupon functionality)->PAYMENT DETAILS (UPI/CARDS)->RANDOM PAYMENT CONFIRMATION (SUCCESS/FAILED/PENDING).
// Also need to have some dynamic theme config from api.
// Tech Stack: Next.js, Typescript, Zustand/Redux, Tailwind
// Round-3: Technical Round

// This round starts with basic introduction then indepth discussion about the assignment build with some follow up questions. Then an indepth discussion on projects in resume and past work experience.
// Some basic theory questions from React. ex. hooks vs functions, diff bw useMemo & useCallback with usecase in production level application, difference bw ~ and ^ in package.json files, any vs unknown in TypeScript, interface vs type and all basic questions.
// Everything was good till now, Now here comes the actual deciding factor questions.
// Given a deeply nested object and write a function which takes a string as a parameter like "user.config.details.name.first" something like this and need to access this from the deeply nested object.
// Polyfills of Promise.any and other methods.
// Some low level DSA like: what sorting is used in inbuilt sort in C++ STL and about priority queue for min/max heap. No leetcode questions asked.
// Round-4: HR Round

// Couldn't able to make into this round.
// But you can expect typical HR questions, it's not that much hard.
// Verdict: Rejected as wasn't familiar with polyfill of Promises and stucked in object question.

// Implement a function called parallelLimit that takes two parameters:

// tasks: An array of functions that return promises
// limit: Maximum number of tasks to run in parallel
// The parallelLimit function should execute the tasks in parallel, but limit the number of concurrent tasks to limit.

// The function should return a promise that resolves to an array of results, where each result is either the resolved value of the task.
