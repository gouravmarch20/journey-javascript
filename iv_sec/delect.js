// How would you design the high-level architecture of Google Photos?
// How would you handle the upload mechanism for photos?
// What would you do if there is a network issue during the upload? How would you ensure the upload resumes rather than starts over?
// How would you track the upload status (e.g., uploaded, in-progress, failed)?
