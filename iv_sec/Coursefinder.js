// Background

// Location: Hyderabad
// Role: SDE-2 - frontend engineer
// Applied: Applied through instahyer a month prior

// Interview Process

// I applied through instahyer and got a call from HR very next day.

// had first level discussion on call and then scheduled a round one interview via third party interview(Bar Raiser).

// I had the worst interview experience ever. Very unprofessional process for hiring. I never write interview experiences but I felt the need for this. So here it goes. 
// Round one (BarRaiser interview) :
// the round was hectic as there ware 3 different types of interviews ware combined in single 1 hour interview.
// i. A Medium-Hard Graph based problem.
// ii. build role based access to a page
// iii. build css grid with diagonal component positioning.  I was able to do all of the questions but couldn’t do the 3rd one as interviewer was expecting and for obvious reason I had only 4-5 mins for this to process the question and code.
// Round two
// had to build their single marketing page in just 2 days. This was very dumb thing to do but I did it anyway and wasted my entire weekend to do this. And in the next round it was hardly looked and discussed for like 5-10 minutes.    Round Three( VP round ):  I got to know the new thing here that when you schedule interview for 3 O’clock that means interviewer will join at Post 3:10. And apparently it’s their standard process. But in my case after 20 mins of wait we got to know that interviewer was stuck in some prod issue(Again understandable coz these things happen)..   the call was rescheduled for same day. With same process of 10 mins wait.. we went over the assignment for 10 mins then discussed all the things that I’ve done in my career. VP was really good and gave me good understanding of the business as well as tech stack.  I was very excited as interview went very well and I also liked the business model and scope of impact.   I didn’t receive any calls for 2-3 days then i called them for updates. they couldn’t gave me any info on that day.   I kept calling in interval of 2 days as I as well as company had put lot of effort in it. After a week they told me that they have an update and will have one more round with Product head.  the call was scheduled on Saturday.  Round four(Product head round):  again the same thing they told me that interviewer will join 10 mins late. After 20-25 mins of wait they told me that interviewer is stuck in some call and will have to cancel the call for the day and will try to schedule coming week (PS. It never happened)  I waited till next Wednesday for them to call to call me. As expected they didn’t. I called them and asked for update on the last round and when to schedule it. HR finally broke the situation to me that they have decided to add one more parameter to the interview process and decided to only hire candidates who have been to tier-1 college. And due to this reason they have decided not to hire me.

// I understand if they rejected me if I’ve performed poorly in interviews. I would understand even if they have said that they are having budget issue. But I don’t understand how can you add more params like this (by which I shouldn’t even be eligibility for interview) after taking multiple hectic rounds.

// Advice to management:

// Please streamline your interview process.
// Hire good HR staff who is at least capable of coming up with the good rejection reaons.
// schedule interviews only when the interviewer will be available to take interview.
