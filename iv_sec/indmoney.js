// I recently had an interview with INDMoney. Initially, the HR representative explained the company, discussed compensation details, and scheduled my interview.

// Round 1:
// The interviewer asked several questions, including:

// Output-based questions related to context and arrow functions.
// Writing a polyfill for Promise.all.
// Finding the value of a given key in a nested object. I explained my approach and wrote the code, but he asked me to optimize it due to performance issues. We moved on when it took longer than expected.
// Grouping data based on a date, which I successfully solved.
// I managed to solve all the questions. At the end of the interview, I asked for feedback and was told, "I like your approach. Everything was okay. You can work on optimization, but it's okay. You are selected for the next round."

// However, when I called HR, I was told that the feedback was mixed and that they would get back to me. Despite the interviewer indicating I was selected for the next round, HRâ€™s response was different, and they never followed up.

// This experience felt like a waste of time. I advise against applying to this company.
