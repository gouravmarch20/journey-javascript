// There were three technical rounds.

// Round 1 - Was asked to create a Job scheduler class in JS which executes job on priority basis, if you have done the lazyMan problem on BFE.dev and promise pool problem, you'll be able to do this as well.

// Round 2 - Create a wrapper around fetch that can be replaced with fetch across the codebase, this wrapper will queue the requests and only allow 10 requests to be active at a time to control the load on the server. Some questions on my current work, etc. How to deep compare two objects.

// Round 3 - Create a pollyfill for Promise. Given an array of urls, shoot the API calls in batches.

// Verdict - Rejected (Wasn't able to fix a bug in the Promise pollyfill).
