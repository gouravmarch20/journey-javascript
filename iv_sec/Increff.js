// I got a chance to interview at Increff for SDE-1 (UI) role. I applied directly through careers page.
// HR told me there would be 3 rounds - 1 test, 2 technical round interview.

// About Me -
// Education: B.Tech Tier 1 (Top 10 NIT)
// Company: SDE1 at Startup
// Years of Experience: 14 months

// Round - 1 Online test
// Had 2 DSA problems easy, medium and 1 frontend task to display data in table format by fetching data from a Api and 10-12 MCQ questions.
// was able to solve DSA but not able to complete the frontend task.

// After 1 week got call from HR that i have been selected for interview.

// Round 2: DSA + JavaScript
// The first round started with a DSA question, where I was asked to solve the asteroid collision problem. I successfully solved it, and we had a discussion on the approach.
// After that, the interviewer asked several JavaScript-related questions:
// Differences between var, let, and const.
// Explanation of promises and how they work.
// A few code snippets related to setTimeout and promises, where I had to determine the execution order.
// A question on the difference between == and === operators in JavaScript.
// A few more questions, which I can’t recall specifically.

// Round 2: Hiring Manager Round
// I was asked to write a function similar to the T9 keyboard (predictive text input). The problem was quite similar to this LeetCode problem.
// After completing that, I was given a few variations of the problem to handle different scenarios.
// Another question involved lists in JavaScript, where I had to write a function to remove an item and filter data from an array.

// Feedback:
// I was rejected after the final round. The feedback given was that I lacked working experience in React.js, and during the interview, I made syntax errors in JavaScript since I wasn’t actively practicing it at the time.
