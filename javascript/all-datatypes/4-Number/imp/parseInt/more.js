// Only the first numbers in the string is returned. Based on the radix (the second argument in order to specify what type of number we want to parse it to: base 10, hexadecimal, octal, binary, etc.), the parseInt checks whether the characters in the string are valid. Once it encounters a character that isn't a valid number in the radix, it stops parsing and ignores the following characters.



const num = parseInt('7*6', 10);
console.log(num);

console.log(parseInt('32px'));
